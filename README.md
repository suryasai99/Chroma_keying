# Chroma_keying

This technique is routinely used in the movie and television industry to replace the background of the actor, newscaster, or weatherman.

A video or live feed of a subject (actor) is shot in front of a solid green screen. Based on the color, the green screen is removed with an interesting background in post production or in real time.

The idea of Chroma-Keying on Green Screening matting has been around for several decades. The techniques were refined in the mid 1960s.

# Description

Input: The input to the algorithm will be a video with a subject in front of a green screen.

Output: The output should be another video where the green background is replaced with an interesting background of your choice. The new background could even be a video if you want to make it interesting.

Controls: You can build a simple interface using HighGUI. It should contain the following parts.

- Color Patch Selector : The interface should show a video frame and the user should be allowed to select a patch of green screen from the background. For simplicity, this patch can be a rectangular patch selected from a single frame. However, it is perfectly find to build an interface where you select multiple patches from one or more frames of the video.

- Tolerance slider : This slider will control how different the color can be from the mean of colors sampled in the previous step to be included in the green background.

- Softness slider (Optional): This slider will control the softness of the foreground mask at the edges.

- Color cast slider (Optional): In a green screen environment, some of the green color also gets cast on the subject. There are some   interesting ways the color cast can be reduced, but during the process of removing the color cast some artifacts are get introduced. So, this slider should control the amount of color cast removal we want.
