# Chroma_keying

This technique is routinely used in the movie and television industry to replace the background of the actor, newscaster, or weatherman.

A video or live feed of a subject (actor) is shot in front of a solid green screen. Based on the color, the green screen is removed with an interesting background in post production or in real time.

The idea of Chroma-Keying on Green Screening matting has been around for several decades. The techniques were refined in the mid 1960s.
